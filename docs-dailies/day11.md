# Day 11
> 2 August 2023

### The Exhibition Approaches
The final sprint of our design journey before the exhibition commences.

### Tasks Accomplished:

- Product Demo Video: Creating a product video to showcase the innovative features of charitable.

### New Concepts/Technologies Learned:

- Video Editing: Making use of iMovie to make videos with transitions, voice overs and music.

### Challenges Faced:
- It was challenging as we are inexperienced in making a video.

### Reflection: 
- Having a product demo video would be beneficial for our static website. iMovie is readily accessible and user-friendly, but we lacked the necessary expertise to utilize it. By closing the knowledge gap, we have gained proficiency in using iMovie.

### Key Learnings:

- Product Demo: A product demo is important as it is often the first few touch points of users before they even interact with a product.

### Reflections:

We struggle with skills that we are unfamiliar with. However, we learned that this was merely a knowledge gap. With the availability of AI tools, we can easily close such gaps, and indeed, it changes our belief that video making is challenging. In this case, feedback from others plays a significant role in unlocking our potential. For instance, the realization that a product demo video is necessary helps us break free from the “video making is hard” mindset.

### Plans for the Next Day:

Over the past three weeks, we have invested our time and effort in developing various components to prepare for tomorrow’s exhibition. Together as a team, we believed that we are able to showcase our work with the audience proudly.
