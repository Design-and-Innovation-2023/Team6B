### Exhibition Day
Today is the day of the exhibition. We got to present the work we had done over the past few weeks.

### Tasks Accomplished:

- Presented our project to visitors, project partners, Professor Jonathan, and Ross. Demonstrated the figma designs and explained the functionalities of CharitAble, emphasizing how it facilitates auto donations.

### New Concepts/Technologies Learned:

- Gained insights into public speaking and presenting complex concepts to diverse stakeholders.

### Challenges Faced:

- Some visitors had specific questions about the implementation of auto donations, which required in-depth technical explanations.

#### Reflection: 
- We learned the importance of anticipating various audience interests and being prepared with clear explanations for both technical and non-technical individuals.

### Key Learnings:

- Effective communication is crucial in project presentations. Being able to adapt and convey ideas clearly in the face of challenges is essential for a successful presentation.
- Understanding the audience’s level of knowledge and tailoring our explanations accordingly can greatly enhance the impact of our message.

### Reflections:

- Today’s exhibition day was both thrilling and challenging. We were proud to showcase our hard work on CharitAble and receive feedback from visitors and experts. The positive response from the audience boosted our team’s morale and reinforced our belief in the value of the project.

- Overall, we feel grateful for the opportunity to present our project and gain valuable experience in public speaking and project showcasing. We recognized the areas where we excelled and the aspects that need improvement. As a team, we communicated well and coordinated effectively during the presentation, which was a significant achievement.

### Plans for the Next Day:
- Tomorrow, on our last day in Glasgow, we plan to reflect on the entire learning journey and discuss the importance of ethics in product design. We aim to conclude our experience on a positive note, cherishing the valuable lessons we’ve learned and discussing how we can apply them in future projects.
