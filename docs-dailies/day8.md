# Day 8
> 28 July 2023

### Gaining Insights from Project Partners

Today, we set up an online meeting with the customers of Barclays where we gather their feedbacks on the application we are building. The main agenda of the meeting are as shown

#### Agenda:

1. Client Feedback on Week 1 Pitch (5-10mins)

2. Team Prototypes Showcase: Donation Process and Landing Page (10 mins)

3. Client Feedback on Prototypes (10 mins)

4. Any Other Business (5-10mins)

Overall, the feedback given by the customers were positive as they find the prototypes appealing.

However, there were some minor changes that the customer requested which includes:

Allowing the application to preselect the interest based on the spending habits of the users
Donation management where users can manage the donations they have made.
With these feedbacks gathered from our meeting, we plan to improve our application to meet these changes requested, increasing the overall customer satisfaction.
