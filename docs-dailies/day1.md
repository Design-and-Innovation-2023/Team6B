### Drafting Questions for Customers
Prior to this course, we had a general idea of what mental model is however after attending the lesson, we gained a better understanding and how it is related to our project. For instance, the customers we interact with may have a completely different view from us thus it is important to understand their point of view and work towards fulfilling their requirements. In addition, we worked together and created a team contract where we can follow closely to promote teamwork and prevent any dispute within the team. As we are meeting the customers on day 2, we have came up with various questions regarding the project to help us gain a better understanding on the requirements of the customers.
