# Day 10
> 1 August 2023

### The Grind Continues
Today, our team received valuable feedback from the professor regarding our static website and poster. After careful consideration, we have decided to make the following changes/improvements:

### Static Website:

- About Us: Include LinkedIn and GitHub links

- Home Page: Description of our work, Figma prototype link, introductory video, screenshots for visitors to have a better understanding of our project.

### Poster:

- Divide the poster into separate sections for problems and solutions to improve its visual organization

- Include a clear process flow for visitor to grasp our idea more effectively

With the project nearing its conclusion, this feedback session has provided us with valuable insights. These insights have enabled us to identify specific areas for refinement and enhancement in both our static website and poster. We are now better prepared for the exhibition this Thursday.
