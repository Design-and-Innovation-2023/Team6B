# Day 9
> 31 July 2023

### Populating the Static Website
Today's work is on adding contents to the static website.

### Tasks Accomplished:

- Static Website: Organising the different topics to be showcased and creating headings for it.

### Challenges Faced:

- What to include: More precisely, what to not include

### Reflection: 
- There are so many things to write about but having too much info will just become boring. By keeping only the important things, readers will naturally form the entire picture in their head.

### Key Learnings:

- Writing: Writing our design process is like writing a book or biography. Many things happens over the days but we only showcase the most important ones. The ones that make a difference.

### Plans for the Next Day:

- Getting feedbacks and finalising our figma. Also continue populating our static website.
