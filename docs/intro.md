# Project Introduction
However, many encountered dilemmas in the decision-making process such as the amount, the charity and frequency which eventually resulted in the idea being scrapped. This is where Barclays comes into the picture to ideate around an Auto Donate application that would suggest charities and the donation amount to individuals based on the spending habits and interests. This aims to provide individuals with a simplistic donation process which may encourage donations for a greater cause.
> This project is created in collaboration with Barclays Bank.
