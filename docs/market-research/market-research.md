# Market Research
After understanding the project requirements in detail, the team proceeded to conduct market research to gain insights into existing platforms and the pain points of the target audiences. This research was done before designing a viable solution that also addresses the pain points encountered during the process.

## Charitable Donations Platforms
[<h2>1. TotalGiving</h2>](https://www.totalgiving.co.uk/)

TotalGiving is an online fundraising platform that allows donors to donate directly to the charities that they are passionate of. However, it does not provide a list of available charities for donors to choose from which indicates that the donors have to search for the desired charities to make a donation and be well aware of the charity's causes and activities as it lacks description of the charity's activities and mission. Donors can donate any amount that they wish to donate.

[<h2>2. JustGiving</h2>](https://www.justgiving.com/)


JustGiving is an online giving platform that has raised over Â£6 billion for charities since its establishment in 2000.Donors can start fundraisers or contribute to existing ones while having the flexibility to donate an amount of their choice. The platform provides donors with a description of the charity's mission and purpose, giving more information about the cause they are supporting.

Overall, these platforms provide donors with the ability to donate to various charities and fundraisers on a single platform, reducing the hassle of researching charities that cater to their desired causes. However, these platforms do not assist donors in making financially sound decisions for the donation amounts or prevent the dilemma that most donors encounter while deciding which charity to donate to. They also do not allow donors to allocate their donation amounts across different charities. Therefore, the Auto Donate Application aims to provide donors with a simplified donation process where both the donation amount and charities will be suggested to aid in decision-making.
