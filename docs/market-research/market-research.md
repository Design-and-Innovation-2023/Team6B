# Market Research
This project is aimed at aiding donors in their decision making process by simplifying their donation process flow with suggestions such as donation amount and charities to donate to based on their financial capabilities and interests indicated. In this section, the team researched on existing donation platforms to determine the viability of the new feature and also to identify the needs of the target audiences.

## Charitable Donations Platforms
[<h2>1. TotalGiving</h2>](https://www.totalgiving.co.uk/)

TotalGiving is an online fundraising platform that allows donors to donate directly to the charities that they are passionate of. However, it does not provide a list of available charities for donors to choose from which indicates that the donors have to search for the desired charities to make a donation and be well aware of the charity's causes and activities as it lacks description of the charity's activities and mission. Donors can donate any amount that they wish to donate.

[<h2>2. JustGiving</h2>](https://www.justgiving.com/)


JustGiving is an online giving platform that has raised over Â£6 billion for charities since its establishment in 2000.Donors can start fundraisers or contribute to existing ones while having the flexibility to donate an amount of their choice. The platform provides donors with a description of the charity's mission and purpose, giving more information about the cause they are supporting.

Overall, these platforms provides donors the ability to donate to various charities and fundraisers on a single platform which reduces the hassle for donors to research on the charities that caters to the cause they are supporting. However, these platforms do not assist donors to make financially sound decisions for the donation amounts or prevents the dilemma that most donors encounter while deciding which charity to donate to. Therefore, with the Auto Donate Application, it will provide donors with a simplified donation process where donation amount and charities would be suggested to them to aid in decision making.
