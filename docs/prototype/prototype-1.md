# Prototype 1 

## Testing the Donation Process Idea
After developing and analyzing the storyboard, the team is ready to move from concept to reality. The next stage of the designing process is to create the first prototype of the CharitAble application. The aim of the first prototype is to test the idea of the donation process with real users and gather feedbacks from them. To do so, the team created the prototype with google forms which consists of the entire donation process where users are required to answer several questions. At this stage, the team did not focus on designing the prototype. The first prototype serves as a proof-of-concept to validate the idea and gather feedback from potential users. Moreover, the team's plan is to test the idea with 20 user before proceeding with the detailed design phase.
### Display of Prototype
The prototype below follows a sequential reading order, beginning from the top left corner and progressing horizontally to the top right corner. From there, it continues downwards in a left-to-right direction until reaching the bottom right corner.

## Results of Prototype
### Percentage of Cash Flow

Based on the response gathered from 20 users, it was found that over 50% of them are keen to donate 25% of their cash flow. The team intends to incorporate this valuable insight into the development of the application and future prototypes.  

### Charities of Interest

The survey revealed that "Feeding Britain" and "Children in Need" were the top two chosen charities, with 70% and 40% of users expressing interest in them, respectively. Since these charities were pre-selected based on the top spending categories, it is evident that users are enthusiastic about donating to these suggested charities. The team is encouraged by this response and believes that recommending charities to users based on their preferences will assist them in their decision-making process.

### Donation Allocation

Based on the gathered feedback, it was found that 80% of users prefer the application to automatically distribute their donation amounts among the selected charities. The team will consider this preference during the application's development. Nevertheless, since there is still a segment of users who prefer manually allocating their donation amounts, the team plans to provide an option for users to edit the allocation even after the application's automatic split.  

### Rating of Donation Process Idea

Based on the collected feedback, over 90% of users expressed satisfaction with the application. The team is delighted with this positive response and is now confident to proceed with designing the prototype for this idea.


### Feedbacks for Improvement

In the received feedback, the majority of users did not provide any specific improvement suggestions. However, the team identified one valuable input where users expressed a preference for charities to be displayed based on their interests rather than directly selecting them. To address this, an additional step will be introduced, where users' interests will be derived from their spending categories, with the option for them to amend these interests. Subsequently, based on these interests, the application will suggest charities and users can select the charities they wish to support. The team is keen on implementing this approach in the future prototype and application as it allows users to express their interests, enabling the application to recommend charities accordingly.

After conducting tests on prototype 1 and collecting user feedback, the team was pleased with the results and is eager to proceed with the further development and design of the design process idea.
