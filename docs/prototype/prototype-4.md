# Prototype 4
## High-Fidelity Prototype (Improved Version)
Moving forward, the team is now ready to create the high-fidelity (hi-fi)prototype, where the idea of the lo-fi prototype will be translated into a more detailed representation, similar to the application. With this prototype, the team will be able to further improve the user experience and functionality of the application. This prototype focuses on the donation process that users encounter during their initial login as part of setting up their account which was mentioned previously in the storyboard, first-time user. By creating the hi-fi prototype, the team aims to bring a user-friendly and simple donation process to the user when using CharitAble.
